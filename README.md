## About
This project is an airbnb clone built with Laravel Inertia Vuejs. The goal was to learn Laravel Inertia and Stripe payments, I gave myself about a week to build this. For that reason the functionality is basic and if it were to be used in production, it would need more work. For example;
- Use webhooks for better payment processing
- Better search functionality for accommodations perhaps using ElasticSearch
- Better error handling
- Better UI/UX
- Better testing
